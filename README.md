# Data analyst Portofolio - Habib Syahni Badri
## About
Hello, my name is Habib. With a background in biological sciences, I have developed a solid foundation in life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover significant insights. I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level professional. Throughout my education, I have honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I gained experience in laboratory procedures, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be useful in my position as a data specialist. In my spare time, I enjoy learning new data analysis tools and methodologies, and I am always seeking ways to broaden my knowledge and skills. Whether working in a team or on my own, I am motivated by the excitement of discovering new insights and the gratification of using data to solve complex challenges.
